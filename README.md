## Original challenge

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

### Guidelines

"FizzBuzz" can be written in countless ways, with countless techniques, but in this exercise each language will implement it in a style representative of the language. For example, that means if a language is object-oriented, it will be made using classes. Also, just because a language supports a certain feature doesn't mean that it is right for this challenge. For instance, just because JavaScript is very good at asynchronous tasks doesn't mean that FizzBuzz should be implemented in an asychronous way. Similarly, a langauge capable of multithreaded processing will not be used in a multithreaded way. Let's keep this simple.

Here are some additional rules:

1. The main code should be a library or module that can be loaded from another file.
2. It should have default values of 1 for the minimum and 100 for the maximum for the range of values.
3. No external libraries. Just core language features.
4. Should be as succinct as possible without loss of readability.
